Summary: 
Building an IP Reputation System Using Honeypot, Wazuh, and Fortigate
Set Up Honeypot

Deploy a honeypot on cloud(e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea) to capture malicious IPs.
Ensure logging is configured to record incoming malicious activity.
Extract Malicious IPs

Write a Python script to parse honeypot logs and extract malicious IP addresses.
Automate the script using cron or another task scheduler to run regularly.
Feed IPs into Wazuh

Configure Wazuh to monitor the file containing the extracted IPs.
Create custom Wazuh rules to alert when malicious IPs are detected.
Check IP Reputation

Use a threat intelligence API (e.g., AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal) to validate the reputation of the extracted IPs.
Update the file with IPs confirmed as malicious.
Block IPs in Fortigate

Write a script that uses Fortigate’s API or CLI to block the malicious IPs dynamically.
Automate this process so new IPs are added to the firewall’s blocklist regularly.
Integrate Everything

Ensure Wazuh triggers the Fortigate block script when a new malicious IP is detected.
Test the entire system to confirm that malicious IPs are detected and blocked.
Logging and Monitoring

Implement logging in your scripts to track blocked IPs and actions.
Use Wazuh dashboards to visualize blocked IPs and system status.
Document the Project

Include code snippets, architecture diagrams, and screenshots.
Optionally, create a video demo to showcase the project for your portfolio.


Technologies Involved:
Honeypot (e.g., Cowrie, Dionaea)
Python for scripting
Wazuh SIEM for monitoring and alerting
Fortigate API or CLI for firewall management
Threat Intelligence APIs (e.g., AbuseIPDB)
By following these steps, you’ll demonstrate skills in security automation, SIEM integration, and firewall management. Let me know if you need more help with any of the steps!
