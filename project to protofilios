To ensure that the Docker container updates the malicious_ips.txt file every time it finds a file with the .csv extension, you can modify the update_ips.py script to process only files ending with .csv. Additionally, you'll run the container using the name ioc-server. Here’s how you can set everything up:

Dockerfile:

dockerfile
Copy code
# Use a lightweight Python image
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy the malicious IPs file and the update script to the container
COPY IPtoblock.txt /app/malicious_ips.txt
COPY update_ips.py /app/update_ips.py

# Install necessary packages
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir pandas

# Expose port 8080
EXPOSE 8080

# Start a Python web server that serves files from /app
CMD ["python", "-m", "http.server", "8080"]
Step 2: Ensure the Python Script Only Processes .csv Files
Your update_ips.py script should already be set to process files with a .csv extension, but just to be sure, here’s the script again:

update_ips.py:

python
Copy code
import os
import pandas as pd

# Directory where CSV files are stored
csv_directory = '/app/csv_files'
output_file = '/app/malicious_ips.txt'

# Create a set to store unique IP addresses
unique_ips = set()

# Iterate through all CSV files in the specified directory
for filename in os.listdir(csv_directory):
    if filename.endswith('.csv'):  # Only process files ending with .csv
        csv_path = os.path.join(csv_directory, filename)
        try:
            # Read the CSV file
            df = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
            # Extract IPs from the 'src_ip' column and add them to the set
            if 'src_ip' in df.columns:
                ips = df['src_ip'].dropna().unique()  # Get unique IPs
                unique_ips.update(ips)
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing file {csv_path}: {e}")

# Write the unique IPs to the output file
with open(output_file, 'w') as file:
    for ip in sorted(unique_ips):
        file.write(f"{ip}\n")

print("IP addresses updated successfully.")
Step 3: Build the Docker Image
Build your Docker image and name it ioc-server:

bash
Copy code
docker build -t ioc-server .
Step 4: Run the Docker Container
When running the Docker container, make sure to mount the directory containing your .csv files to /app/csv_files. Here’s how to do it:

bash
Copy code
docker run -d -p 8080:8080 -v /path/to/csv_files:/app/csv_files ioc-server
Replace /path/to/csv_files with the actual path on your host where the CSV files are stored.

Step 5: Set Up a Cron Job for Daily Updates
To ensure the malicious_ips.txt file gets updated every day, you can set up a cron job on the host machine as mentioned earlier:

Open the crontab editor:

bash
Copy code
crontab -e
Add a line to run the update script every day at a specific time (e.g., 2 AM):

bash
Copy code
0 2 * * * docker exec ioc-server python /app/update_ips.py
This command tells the cron job to execute the update_ips.py script inside the ioc-server container every day at 2 AM.

Summary
The script is set up to process only .csv files.
The Docker image is built with the name ioc-server.
A cron job is configured to run the update script daily.
This setup will ensure your malicious_ips.txt file is updated every day with unique IP addresses from any new CSV files added to the specified directory.


getting csv files for ioc and this is atuomated job that update the ip list to container and its update daily,
next creat Wazug rule

I will use Apache Directory Studio,
just wonder if I can join domain a ubuntu that I have, and how do I grant local admin to users and limit access
and it does.
